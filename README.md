Vendetta Mobile
===

Is a mobile app built on Ruby on Rails, using jQuery mobile. This app was build for my ball hockey team named Vendetta. 
It was one of my earlier experiences with Rails, I built the app as a way to improve my Ruby, Rails and general software/app development skills. But it was also a way to provide my team with something fun for them to use. 

**This app is no longer being maintained**

It had positive feedback while it lasted, quoted being better than the official ball hockey website which offered a subpar mobile experience.

To have data available, I constructed an API made of JSON files that are updated several times a night on game day. To build the files I used two libraries for scraping the ball hockey website for players and stats and downloading the schedule; Web Parser and CalFile Parser (see my github repo list).
